## Phase 1 Progress
4/27th:

Our team met to decide on a research question together over zoom! We came up with many different potential question, but we came down to one that is relevant to our lives. After that we decided to split up the work for phase1 for all of us to work on on monday. We were able to break it up evenly and everyone was satisfied with today's work!

4/28th:

Today we worked on the work that we split up when we had time, and will be meeting after today's class to decide what to do next! Overall we are excited to tackle this project!
