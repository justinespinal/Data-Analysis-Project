### Identification of potential linkage keys for dataset 
- CP03 (comparative Economic Characteristics)
- S0804 (Means of Transportation to Work by Selected characteristics for workplace Geography)

| Potential Linkage Key | Description | Why it is suitable for linkage |
|------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **GEOID**              | A geographic identifier (e.g., PUMA, Census Tract, ZIP code). | Both datasets are organized geographically; GEOID allows you to join by location. |
| **Age Group**          | Worker age groups (e.g., 16-19 years, 20-24 years, etc.). | Both CP03 and S0804 break down data by age categories, so it can link transportation behavior with economic characteristics by age group. |
| **Income Level**       | Household or individual income brackets. | Both datasets provide income-related data, allowing analysis by economic status across commuting and workplace behavior. |
| **Sex (Gender)**       | Male / Female categories. | Both datasets often segment results by gender, enabling gender-specific commuting and economic analysis. |
| **Employment Status**  | Employment categories (e.g., employed, unemployed, not in labor force). | Some sections in CP03 and S0804 relate to employment statu. |
