After our group merged all the tables together, I got the output CSV file of the merged table and imported it into Tableau, which can create different sheets using the imported data. So I create one base info sheet that shows that: 
The rows are the borough, city, zip code, and AGI Stub, and the columns are using the average Daily trips, trip duration, and households to show some base info for the group of columns.
