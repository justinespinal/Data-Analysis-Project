## Research Question
How does median household income correlate with commuting time and public vs. private transportation usage in New York City neighborhoods?

## Dataset Descriptions 

Dataset Number 1: Means of Transportation to Work by Selected Characteristics

This dataset comes from the 2023 American Community Survey. It provides information about how people commute to work in the US, which will be filtered for only those in NYC, broken down by different characteristics such as income level, age, and vehicle access. It is important because it shows the number and percentage of workers using public transportation (subways, buses, etc.), private vehicles (cars, trucks), biking, walking, or working from home.

Dataset Number 2: SOI Tax Stats - Individual income tax statistics 

The IRS's 2022 ZIP Code dataset offers a detailed view of individual income tax statistics across the United States, broken down by ZIP code, state, and adjusted gross income (AGI) brackets. It encompasses key metrics such as the number of tax returns filed (approximating households), personal exemptions (approximating population), AGI, wages and salaries, dividends, and interest income.

Dataset Number 3: 2023 High Volume FHV Trip Data

This dataset supplies us with detailed records of trips conducted by high-volume FHV services, such as Uber and Lyft, throughout New York City in 2023.
