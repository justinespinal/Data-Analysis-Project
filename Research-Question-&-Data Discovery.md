## Dataset Descriptions 

Dataset Number 1: Means of Transportation to Work by Selected Characteristics
This dataset comes from the 2023 American Community Survey. It provides information about how people commute to work in the US, which will be filtered for only those in NYC, broken down by different characteristics such as income level, age, and vehicle access. It is important because it shows the number and percentage of workers using public transportation (subways, buses, etc.), private vehicles (cars, trucks), biking, walking, or working from home.

Dataset Number 2: Comparative Economic Characteristics 
This dataset includes statistics about the average and median commuting times for New York City workers, cross-referenced with household income levels. It shows how commute times vary across different income brackets, and sometimes by neighborhood or borough. This dataset is important because it highlights patterns like whether higher-income individuals tend to have shorter or longer commutes compared to lower-income individuals.

**Why the datasets are relevant and related**
Both of these datasets focus on commuting behaviors and economic characteristics in New York City, which is directly tied to our groups research question. Using both of these datasets in our project we are able to analyze both the method of commuting and the time spent commuting, and how income might influence both factors.
